# San-Antonio-Campaign-Finance
A collection of scripts to clean, parse, and plot campaign finance data in local elections. 

My goal is to produce useful, and reproducible, analysis of campaign contributions in the 2017 San Antonio mayoral and City Council elections.  Eventually, Iâ€™d like to generalize the scripts to take advantage of statewide data.  The key is for the scripts be easily rerun as more data comes in so the analysis can scale.
